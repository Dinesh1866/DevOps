Python is a High level, Object Oriented Dynamically typed and Interpreted Programming  and Scripting Language. It is a general purpose programming language and is used for a wide variety of applications like Web Development, Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, etc.

<br>

> Dynamic Typing: In Python, we don't need to declare the type of the variable. The type of the variable is determined at runtime.

> Interpreted Language: Python is an interpreted language. It means that the code is not compiled into machine language. Instead, it is converted into bytecode and then interpreted by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).

> Object Oriented: Python is an Object Oriented Programming Language. It supports Object Oriented Programming features like Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, etc.

## Variables
Variables are used to store data. In Python, we don't need to declare the data type of the variable. The type of the variable is determined at runtime.

>variables are the name given to the memory location where the data is stored.

>syntax: variable_name = value
```python
# variable declaration
a = 10
b = 20
print(a, b) # o/p: 10 20
```

## Data Types
Python has 5 data types:
- int
- float
- complex
- bool
- str

> int: It is used to store integer values. It is a signed integer. It can store values from -2^31 to 2^31-1.

> float: It is used to store floating point values. It is a signed floating point. It can store values from -2^31 to 2^31-1.

> complex: It is used to store complex numbers. It is a signed complex number. It can store values from -2^31 to 2^31-1.

> bool: It is used to store boolean values. It can store either True or False.

> str: It is used to store string values. It is a sequence of characters.

```python
# int
a = 10
print(type(a)) # o/p: <class 'int'>

# float
a = 10.5
print(type(a)) # o/p: <class 'float'>

# complex
a = 10 + 5j
print(type(a)) # o/p: <class 'complex'>

# bool
a = True
print(type(a)) # o/p: <class 'bool'>

# str
a = "Hello World"
print(type(a)) # o/p: <class 'str'>
```
> Note: In Python, we can use single quotes or double quotes to declare a string.

> type() is a built-in function which is used to get the type of the variable.
