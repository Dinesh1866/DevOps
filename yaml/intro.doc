YAML - Yet Another Markup Language -> thats how its called before 
but now 
YAML - called YAML ain't a Markup Language

and its all because now its not like other markup languages like only to handle documents.

but here now in yaml we can also store objects and data.
and can also represent the complex data in a easy way.

and this is how represent data in yaml -> intro.yaml
impt: YAML is case sensitive.

and we also have websites to check the syntax and convert the YAML into JSON file.
yamllint.com
onlineyamltools.com

to seperate the documents we use three dashes ->  ---
to end the documents we use three dots -> ...

and yaml don't allow us to write data in diff lines for comments or anything.
so here we use '|' before so we can store value in multiple lines.

and to store the diff line values in one line we use '>'

and to know the datatypes and how to write them,
where we use can refer datatypes.yml

and for some advanced topics can refer the advancedDataType.yml
